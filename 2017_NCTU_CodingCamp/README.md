# 2017 NCTU CodingCamp
<h3>

This repository stores what I learned and practiced during the Coding Camp held by NCTU in year 2017. <br>
After couple days of training, I now realize how important the algorithm and data structures mean to a programmer <br>
Therefore, I decided to sort out everything I learned, I wrote and put them all in here for future look-ups. <br><br>
